Transforms promise chains into `async`/`await`. I wrote this to refactor the 5000+ `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` calls in the
`sequelize` codebase. This is slightly inspired by [async-await-codemod](https://github.com/sgilroy/async-await-codemod),
but written from scratch to guarantee the same behavior and tidy code as best as I can manage.

## Usage

```
npx @codemodsquad/asyncify path/to/your/project/**/*.js
```

This command just forwards to `jscodeshift`, you can pass other `jscodeshift` CLI options.

## Warnings

Comments can sometimes get deleted due to an impedance mismatch between `@babel` and `recast`
ASTs. If you use the `--commentWorkarounds=true` option it will try to prevent more comments
from getting deleted but it sometimes causes an assertion to fail in `recast`.

There are a few edge cases where `asyncify` produces funky output. It's intended to not break
any existing behavior (I know of no cases where it does, and I have fixed several such issues)
but sometimes the output will be be semantically wrong even if it behaves
correctly. For example, I've seen a case where doing an async operation several times in a row:

```js
it('test', () => {
  const doSomething = () => {
    // ...
  }

  return doSomething()
    .then(doSomething)
    .then(doSomething)
}
```

Gets converted to:

```js
it('test', async () => {
  const doSomething = () => {
    // ...
  }
  await doSomething(await doSomething(await doSomething()))
})
```

This works even though it initially seems like it wouldn't and is obviously not what you want:

```js
it('test', async () => {
  const doSomething = () => {
    // ...
  }
  await doSomething()
  await doSomething()
  await doSomething()
})
```

Although I could possibly fix this for cases where it's easy to determine that the function has
no parameters, there could be cases where it's impossible to determine whether the identifier
`doSomething` is even a function or whether it has parameters.

## Disabling `recast` workaround

At the time I wrote `asyncify`, there were some show-stopping bugs in old version of `recast` that
`jscodeshift` depended on. To avoid this problem, `asyncify` parses with a newer version of `recast` in its
own dependencies, instead of parsing with the `jscodeshift` API. The author of `putout` has asked to be able
to parse with the injected `jscodeshift` API for performance, so you can access that version of the
`jscodeshift` transform as:

```js
import transform from '@codemodsquad/asyncify/noRecastWorkaround'
```

Or there are two ways you can do it when running via `jscodeshift`:

```
jscodeshift -t path/to/asyncify/noRecastWorkaround.js
jscodeshift -t path/to/asyncify/index.js --noRecastWorkaround=true
```
